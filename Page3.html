  <p>Each of these essays takes a different stab at how technology reifies, norms, legitimizes, and
exercises its domain over users. What competing ideas are present in these essays about the
agentive power of technology? Do you get the sense that technology critiques lean too hard
toward technology determinism? Or is there a more fine line?</p>

  <p>Don't just attempt to answer these prompts.</p>

 <h3>Student Assignment Submission</h3>

  <p>Reading Response 2</p>

  <p>To answer the questions, here are my two main points first followed by a more detailed analysis:</p>

  <p>(1) Technology does not dictate society’s nature and culture. People can choose to engage with
technology or not. Engaging with technology is not compulsory (unless we’re talking about that
big, fat violation of the Nuremburg Code, vaccine mandates, that I ain’t ever engaging; and what
a coincidence that one of the essays mentions NASA, one of the other results of WWII "Operation 
Paperclip." Way to bring it all together, Prof.).</p>

  <p>(2) "Agentive power" is another way of saying "proxy." And another way to say "proxy" is
"astroturfing." These three essays all blame technology for disseminating and perpetuating white
male hegemony, colonialism, and capitalism to the detriment of women and nonwhites. But
here’s the thing... in this country, people have the opportunity to go out and create their own
businesses and generate their own prosperity and nobody can stop them except them. There are
all kinds of grants out there for women and nonwhites to do exactly that if they feel like the
corporate arena is stifling their aptitudes. But they need to have something to offer and they’d
better not allow certain political factions to psychologically condition them to undermine
themselves through shame and victimhood or they will fail in their ventures and in life. Never
engage in self-deception.</p>

  <p>I’ll start with the essay, "awaywithwords." This essay doesn’t work in the context of corporate
content management systems. The author comes off as someone who has romanticized the role
of technical writers to the point of being totally out of touch with the reality of technical writing
in the corporate arena [currently being outsourced and offshored]. This essay is dated and loaded with 
pseudo intellectualism masquerading as "truth."</p>

  <p>The essay entitled, "The Cognitive Style of PowerPoint," brings up a good point about the space
shuttle Columbia disaster. Engineers made the mistake of trying to condense complex
information into summarized bullet points without distributing accompanying reports that fully
explained the danger of explosion upon reentry into Earth’s atmosphere and its effect on the
seven lives aboard the shuttle. But then the author goes on to blame Microsoft and corporate
culture for imposing PowerPoint on the populous. Using any Microsoft product is a choice and
people are responsible for the consequences of their choices, not the corporation selling the
software. Personally, I’ve worked in both the private and public sectors and I have never seen any
scientist or CPA disseminate complex information in PowerPoint. They write long reports and
distribute those reports to board members. Besides that, PowerPoint is excellent for Human
Resources orientation presentations. Also, the I.T. Dept. comes in and disseminates computer
use rules via PowerPoint presentations so it works there too. That’s pretty simple information
that is perfectly suited to presentation software.</p>

  <p>Now for the essay entitled, "The Politics of the Interface." This essay in particular incorporates
every tenet of critical race theory including intersectionality and Marxism. This essay engages in the
hypocrisy logical fallacy when it seeks to use "anti-racism" to try to undermine others via
racism and sexism (target white men exclusively) [while claiming that those who created the technology 
that made this article and its dissemination possible are motivated by racism.]
It’s also hypocritical for English teachers, professors, and other political factions to use youth as their 
personal "proxies" in order to undermine society while hiding out in their artificially manufactured leftist fiefdoms feeding at the 
taxpayer trough. Action without consequence does not exist. And no, critical race theory is not "widely accepted pedagogy" 
if 23 states have banned it or are in the process of banning it.</p>

  <p>Besides the aforementioned essay being steeped in CRT, which is a circular argument logical
fallacy [a circular argument assumes what it attempts to prove], the authors engage in a false equivalence logical 
fallacy when they compare the computer science industry to the maintaining of border security. 
These are two dissimilar things. Further, the authors engage in the exaggeration logical fallacy and 
hypocrisy logical fallacy [again] when they state that:</p>

  <p class="blockquote">Students who want to use computers are continually confronted
with these grand narratives which foreground a value on middleclass,
corporate culture; capitalism and the commodification of
information; Standard English; and rationalistic ways of
representing knowledge. These values simultaneously do violence
to and encourage the rejection of the languages of different races
and the values of non-dominant cultural and gender groups. When
students from these groups enter the linguistic borderlands of the
interface, in other words, they often learn that they must abandon
their own culture or gender and acknowledge the dominance of
other groups.</p>

  <p>Firstly, there’s no ethnic cleansing going on in this country that forces students who use
computers to abandon their own cultures, languages, and genders. That’s an exaggeration.
Students can participate in computer literacy and economic viability and still
retain their identities. It’s a choice. Secondly, the English teachers who wrote this essay seeking
to impose their leftist ideology on students are themselves middle class and trying to exert [their own brand of]
"dominance." That’s hypocritical [while accusing computer science proprietors of hypocrisy]. 
Most of these people go directly from being a college student to being a teacher or professor. 
That means they have zero experience working in the private sector, never served in the military, 
never lived abroad (especially not in hostile territory), and never actually had to fight for their 
own survival because they grew up in "quiet, peaceful neighborhoods." Experience is the source of 
wisdom; books are the source of knowledge. Wisdom and knowledge are very different things.</p>

  <p>That said, all three of these essays reek of envy and bitterness towards successful men in particular and that’s 
disturbing, especially since no counter viewpoints are offered in the reading. Personally, 
I like successful men and I especially like strong, successful men. As a woman (not chest-feeding person) 
I don’t feel like a victim and have zero interest in undermining men because I am secure 
in my own aptitudes and person, and have a lot of experience navigating predators.</p>

  <p>The truth is that technical writers have been, or are being, phased out of the corporate arena via
outsourcing and offshoring of their jobs. The market does determine business decisions of this
nature to a large degree, but this is being done with the skill and proficiency of corporate
attorneys deliberately moving these [woke] people out of corporations. My perspective on that is that
corporate leaders don’t appreciate those without business and computer science expertise coming
in and telling them how to run their businesses while not bringing much to the table outside of
[woke] ideology. But I would really like to know what Thomas Sowell thinks of this situation from an
economic, conservative perspective.</p>

 <h3>Professor's grade and comments on my essay "Reading Response 2."</h3>

  <p>PROFESSOR COMMENTS</p>

  <p>I see you rejecting the arguments of each of these readings at face value. For what it’s worth, the
reading responses serve as a tool to allow students to analyze common arguments and critiques
about technology. Your analysis, however, remains entirely on the surface. There are any number
of ways to critique and analyze what is presented here while still disagreeing with the implications
and arguments of each. In future reading responses do try to engage with what is being said with a
clear and analytical approach. Humor and style are welcome additions but are not substitutions for
strength of analysis. Half Credit.</p>

  <h3>Student's Response to Professor</h3>

  <p>STUDENT RESPONSE</p>

  <p>As a staunch conservative, the readings were thoroughly offensive as only one biased (leftist)
viewpoint was presented to the class. If your goal is really to focus on "technology" and not
ideology as you stated, then don't serve up this indoctrination material to students. It lacks the
intellectual "diversity" and "inclusion" [University Name] supposedly espouses. Nice subterfuge. This is exactly
why the English department shouldn’t administer technological aspects of this degree. It should be
handled by the Computer Science Department that would actually make us read technological
publications. One of those supposed "technological" essays that you assigned had the audacity to
outline how English teachers should indoctrinate kids. That’s English teachers overstepping their
authority and overestimating their value in society. They only got away with it for so long because
parents didn’t know what was going on in the classroom. Now that parents know what’s going on,
there’s a huge uprising across this nation against leftist indoctrination in schools and legislative
banning of CRT in half the country.</p>

  <p>That said, you are grading with bias and it won’t force me to modify my behavior in the least. You
need to change the type of reading material you’re presenting to this class. It's OFFENSIVE. No
conservative professor, or any professor who respected conservative viewpoints for that matter,
would ever assail conservative students in this class with that leftist tripe. You professors, who are
busy hiding out in college to avoid the real world and its consequences (many of whom have zero
real-world experience doing what they’re teaching and actually demonstrate a certain level of
incompetence), don’t know more than some of the students in your classes, and need to stop with
the smug, pretentious, arrogance you display and do your jobs without imposing your "personal
values" on students. And why is the English department at [University Name] hiring out-of-state leftists instead
of in-state conservatives? Surely it’s not discrimination.</p>
