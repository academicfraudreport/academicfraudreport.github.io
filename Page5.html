<h2>Response</h2>
<p>Following is the head of the department's response to my original complaint. He asked for clarification about how the professor's grading was "arbitrary and capricious." I responded with clarification and a PDF attachment of my grades and professor comments in Canvas. I did not include the PDF attachment here because names and email addresses are included, but I saved everything and can email it upon request. Notice that in my response below I mention that the English professor lowered my grade for "indenting" HTML and CSS code, which only proved the English professor did not know anything about coding. So why was this English professor grading coding when he is clearly incompetent? By the way, I created this site manually in HTML 5 and CSS.</p>

<p>Dear [Student],</p>

<p>Thank you for your email. Here is the link for students to report academic complaints: [No link was provided.]</p>

<p>The first step is for you to try and resolve the issue with your instructor--in this case Dr.
[Last Name]. Second step: once you feel those appeals have been exhausted, the next step is to
appeal to the Department Chair--in this case, me. If resolution is not achieved there are
subsequent steps to follow, which I am glad to explain.</p>

<p>In the meantime, here is the Standard of Review.</p>

<p>Standard of Review: A decision regarding a general academic issue will be reviewed to
determine whether it was arbitrary or capricious. In deciding whether the decision was arbitrary
and capricious, deference is given to the faculty member (or other appropriate decision-maker),
but may be reviewed to determine whether the decision was supported by evidence on which the
faculty member could reasonably base their decision or whether the decision exceeds the bounds
of reasonableness and rationality. A decision is supported by sufficient evidence if a reasonable
mind could reach the same conclusion as did the faculty member (or other appropriate decision
maker) based on the evidence available to the faculty member (or other appropriate decision maker).
The decision should also be consistent with other similar decisions.</p>

<p>So as I begin to review the case, please spell out specifically how the professor's grading has
been "arbitrary and capricious". That will help me better understand your complaint.</p>

<p>If you have any questions in the meantime, please be in touch.</p>

<p>Dear Prof. [Last Name]:</p>

<p>There's no link in your email so... I found the grievance procedure online and wrote the
grievance. I was planning on sending it outside your department because I remember you in
English [xxxx] when you replaced Prof. [Name]. You defended critical race theory and the
professors teaching it. I don't know if I should trust you because it looks like you protect faculty
first (above students).</p>

<p>That said, I'll give you a chance. I have attached the PDF to this email without forwarding it yet.
It's the text of the grievance with all the supporting evidence. I'll paste just the text here as well
because you're missing the major point of my original message, which is fraud. I was upset when
I wrote the original message so I probably didn't state my case clearly. I wrote the grievance with
a clearer head. As far as the biased grading goes, look at the Final Working Prototype Tutorial
project, grade, and comments, but read this first. Here's the text. Be forewarned that I included
you in it because of past experience. Also, the formatting is better in the PDF.</p>

<h3>Text of PDF Attachment:</h3>

<p>This is a student grievance with supporting evidence (attached) concerning Professor [Name], 
who is currently teaching English [xxxx], CRN [xxxxx]. My main objective is to ensure
college administrators outside the English department are made aware of faculty behavior within
the English Department so that current and future students are not adversely impacted by what is
occurring in this class. The problem with English 3130 is that the course description and the
actual course content are very different. The course description is as follows:</p>

<p class="blockquote">This course will introduce students to the tools/software that
technical writers and other professionals use in the workplace.
Topics include, but are not limited to, Advanced Features in MS
Word (styles, macros), the Adobe Suite, Advanced Features of
online collaborative tools (the Google Suite among others), the
suite of Apple products. This instruction prepares students, not just
English majors, for the necessary skills to enter into the workforce
prepared to succeed.</p>

<p>The course description implies to readers that students will be taught various software packages
by the instructor relevant to technical writing course in order to better prepare students for the
workforce. That is not what is occurring in Prof. [Name]’s class. He is not using assignments to
teach advanced software features. Students are expected to learn software on their own time
and/or bring their own skillsets to complete these assignments. For example, Prof. [Name]
assigned to the class the Script and Final Working Prototype Tutorial assignments for students to
demonstrate an advanced feature in a software program of their choosing, but is not using class
time to teach this software (see Module 2, "Examples of Advanced Features, " page 6, "Script
(Outline)," pages 10-11 and Module 3, "Final (Working Prototype Tutorial)" pages 20-21 for
assignment descriptions). This is contrary to [PPM] Section 3.2.8, "Faculty Responsibility to Students,"
which states, "The student has the right to expect substantive presentations or other means of
instruction appropriate to the course." Where is the substantive presentation by the instructor for
the tools and software we will be using in the workforce?</p>

<p>The bulk of Prof. [Name]'s assignments consist of reading English and technical writing
publications that apply critical race theory to computer technology. These readings (pages 54-166) 
express the tenets of critical race theory (especially the Selfe reading beginning on page 54)
without ever overtly using the term "critical race theory." Students are expected to submit
reading responses and discussion board posts to Prof. [Name]’s prompts (See Module 2-4
Overviews pages 4-25). However, Prof. [Name] subtracts 50 percent of total available points if
students fail to acknowledge how computer technology protects and perpetuates "white male
hegemony" to the detriment of women and nonwhites (ironic since Prof. [Name] is that very
demographic imposing his ideology on me, a female). That is a failing grade for assignments and
constitutes intimidation and retaliation for failure to agree with or express the professor’s
viewpoints that computer technology oppresses women and nonwhites (yet somehow this
hypocrisy eludes a PhD). That is a violation of [PPM] Section 3.2.3, "Faculty Responsibility to
Students," which states "Faculty members shall not reward agreement or penalize disagreement
with their views on controversial topics."</p>

<p>Not only does Prof. [Name] penalize students for failure to adopt his ideology, but he prefaces
his prompts with what he expects students to say with statements like this:</p>

<p class="blockquote">It's not the knowledge of the technology that proves to be our
primary skill but instead the ways we can think carefully about
what we create and for whom we create. In other words, in matters
of technology: the right avenue for the aspiring writer is to be
inquisitive, analytical, and critical of editing software interfaces,
and capabilities. The readings and discussions for this module are
designed to give you the analytical tools to take this on (Module 4
Overview, page 23).</p>

<p>And this: "We'll also continue talking about the impacts of interfaces on our writing and we'll
discuss the affordances of various user-interfaces in our writing editors" (Module 4 Overview,
page 22).</p>

<p>Prof. [Name] means applying critical race theory to computer technology, but he is keeping it
vague to hide it from someone (the head of the department or dean?). Prof. [Name] is implying
that ideology is more valuable to employers than skillsets that produce results. I have been in the
workforce for a long time and I know from experience that this statement is false, especially in
the private sector, which is actively undermining the technical writing field through outsourcing
and offshoring. Employers hire ability, not ideology. Prof. [Name] conceals his intent in
vagaries like this while getting the message across to students about what he expects to read in
reading responses and discussion board posts. Failure to adhere to Prof. [Name]'s expectations
means that he will deduct points under some other pretext because students are not allowed to
submit opposing viewpoints or point out the hypocrisy, racism, and sexism inherent in the
readings that target white men specifically. That is coercion. No one will use my gender to
promote their agenda. Prof. [Name] is not teaching technology himself and is using students’
presentations and their prior knowledge of computer technology as a cover to hide and legitimize
another agenda (stealth indoctrination).</p>

<p>Several examples of Prof. [Name]'s retaliatory grading are in the Grades section of the
attachment (pages 47-53) for Reading Responses and projects. The most egregious example is
the "Final (Working Prototype Tutorial)" assignment for Module 3. Compare Prof. [Name]’s
instructions for this assignment (pages 20-21) with his comments and reasoning for lowering my
grade in the Grades section (page 51).</p>

<p class="blockquote">The biggest issue is the logic of your bullet points. To create a
more usable document all your bullets should be the same type of
information (e.g. notes OR context OR description OR warnings)
You can use other types of bullets or other design tools to denote
other forms of writing. This is most important when creating steps
in your instructions.</p>

<p>Firstly, I followed the original instructions in the assignment. This is another set of instructions
that is not part of the original instructions. My presentation is a step-by-step process. I created
instructions for how to build a CSS and attach it to an HTML webpage. I submitted the code
with a screenshot of how the webpage renders in a browser along with the PowerPoint
presentation (pages 26-46). The PowerPoint presentation is all that was due for this assignment.</p>

<p>Secondly, I far exceeded the expectations for this assignment yet received 50 percent of the total
points. That is a failing grade. Prof. [Name] made another comment in the Grades section that
my HTML code is "indented" while the CSS code is not and that both should be uniform. This
proves Prof. [Name]'s incompetence in comprehending HTML code. Any indentation or
spacing inside HTML code is coder-specific, meaning coder preference so that the coder can find
specific pieces of code more easily in case they need editing. Some coders use spaces, some use
indentations, and some left justify. I indent. The space inside HTML code is irrelevant to the
presentation of a webpage as it is not rendered. Someone in the Computer Science Department
should grade this website project, not Prof. [Name]. He does not know what he is talking about.
I brought this skillset to the class, Prof. [Name] did not, but he is capitalizing on it to hide his
primary objective.</p>

<p>The coercion and retaliation in English [xxxx] creates a hostile environment for students who were
misled into enrolling in this class. It definitely does not create "an atmosphere of original
thinking, research and writing" ([PPM] Section 3.2.9). This leads me to believe that there is a certain
level of corruption operating in the English Department at [University Name]. Someone is
cultivating and protecting this environment within the English Department because this same
problem occurred in English [xxxx] under Professor [Name]. Professor [Name] took over
English [xxxx] (Spring 2021) because Professor [Name] abandoned the class in the middle of the
semester without telling anyone anything. I’m not sure if the head of the department (Prof. [Name]) 
or the dean is cultivating this environment or if individual professors are going rogue
behind their backs and operating covertly, but this behavior needs to stop. It targets and
undermines students with actual critical thinking skills and politicizes class content. I did not
enroll in a critical race theory class. I enrolled in a technical writing class that is supposed to be
teaching computer applications to better prepare students for the workforce or to enhance
preexisting skillsets. The class description versus the actual class content does not match and
constitutes fraud.</p>

<p>I am also enrolled in Prof. [Name]’s English [xxxx] class, but I do not want to continue in that
class or in English [xxxx] because of the bias and retaliation that I am experiencing. And once this
grievance is submitted, I suspect it will only worsen. I prefer to be moved to a different section
with a different instructor, but I do not want to abandon other students to Prof. [Name].
Someone needs to advocate for students. I am the only student providing a counter viewpoint to
the biased readings, but it is costing me my GPA. I contacted the head of the department
regarding this matter, but he seems to be more about saving face and protecting professors at the
expense of students (judging from past experience in English [xxxx]). Maybe Prof. [Dept. Head] will
do the right thing and protect students, but I cannot say for sure. That is the reason I am
submitting this student grievance outside the English Department.</p>
