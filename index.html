 <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>The purpose of this site is to report an incident of fraud in a Utah university. The class was conducted 100 percent online, which is technically wire fraud. In lieu of mailing a large packet of paperwork or attaching a 260+ page PDF to an email message, I built this website to organize content in the most efficient way possible and send a simple URL to the Utah Attorney General's office. The details are in PDFs downloaded from the student portal in Canvas. That is deliberate. PDFs and images are not search engine readable. This site has not been search engine optimized. Also, I deleted names and email addresses to protect privacy, but will name the individuals and submit contact information in the initial complaint form downloaded from the Utah Attorney General's website.

 <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The "Home" page includes the catalog course description, the syllabus course description, and what actually occurred in the class versus what was supposed to happen as advertised in the college catalog and syllabus during the fall semester 2021. The "Assignments" page includes a link to the syllabus, linked assignment descriptions, and linked readings exactly as they were in the student portal in Canvas during the class. The "Example" page contains an actual assignment description, readings for Module 4, my submitted reading response essay, and the professor's grade and comments on my essay. The "Complaint" page contains my original complaint about the class content not matching the catalog or syllabus that I sent to the head of the English Department on October 25, 2021. The "Response" page is the head of the department's response to my complaint.</p>

 <h2><Fraud></h2>

   <h3>Catalog Course Description</h3>

  <p>The catalog course description is as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li>ENGL [xxxx] - Digital Writing Technologies</li><br>
 <li>Credits: (3)</li><br>
 <li>Typically Taught Fall Semester: Full Sem</li><br>
 <li>Typically Taught Spring Semester: Full Sem</li><br>
 <li>Course Fee: $20.00</li>
</ul>
<br>

  <p class="blockquote">This course will introduce students to the tools/software that technical writers and
other professionals use in the workplace. Topics include, but are not limited to,
Advanced Features in MS Word (styles, macros), the Adobe Suite, Advanced
Features of online collaborative tools (the Google Suite among others), the suite
of Apple products. This instruction prepares students, not just English majors, for
the necessary skills to enter into the workforce prepared to succeed.

  <h3>Syllabus Course Description</h3>

 <p>Course description & learning outcomes:</p>

  <p class="blockquote">This course introduces students to the tools/software that technical writers and other
professionals use in the workplace. Topics include, but are not limited to, Advanced Features in
MS Word (styles, macros), the Adobe Suite, Advanced Features of online collaborative tools
(the Google Suite among others), the suite of Apple products. This instruction prepares
students, not just English majors, for the necessary skills to enter into the workforce prepared to
succeed.</p>

  <p>The catalog course description and syllabus course description are identical. Since the professor wrote the syllabus he cannot claim no intent to deceive. The course description implies that students will be taught various software packages by the professor relevant to a technical writing course in order to better prepare students for the workforce. That is not what occurred in this class. Instead, students were expected to learn software on their own time and/or bring their own skillsets to complete major assignments as the bulk of assignments consisted of reading English and technical writing publications that applied critical race theory (CRT) to computer technology. These readings expressed the tenets of critical race theory without ever overtly using the term "critical race theory" anywhere in the text (see "The Politics of the Interface" in particular on the "Assignments" page). Students were expected to submit reading responses and discussion board posts to prompts prefaced by the professor with statements like this:</p>

  <p class="blockquote">It's not the knowledge of the technology that proves to be our primary skill but instead the ways we can think carefully about what we create and for whom we create. In other words, in matters of technology: the right avenue for the aspiring writer is to be inquisitive, analytical, and critical of editing software interfaces, and capabilities. The readings and discussions for this module are designed to give you the analytical tools to take this on. (See Module 4 Assignment Descriptions.)</p>

<p>And this: "We'll also continue talking about the impacts of interfaces on our writing and we'll discuss the affordances of various user-interfaces in our writing editors." (See Module 4 Assignment Descriptions.)</p>

  <p>"The knowledge of technology" is the reason students enrolled in this class. The professor did not utilize class readings and assignments to teach technology himself nor did students have any computer applications assignments that would progressively build skills before being required to submit major computer applications assignments. The professor used students’ computer applications skillsets as cover to make it look like he was teaching computer applications and fulfilling the catalog course description without ever actually teaching computer applications to instead engage in stealth indoctrination. That is a deliberate misrepresentation by the professor of class content versus the class description.</p> 

  <p>This is contrary to the university's Policy and Procedures Manual (PPM), Student Rights, Section 5.2.7.3, which states, "The right to competent academic instruction and
advisement such that students may: Expect that courses offered will be comparable with their catalog descriptions, and that reasonable attempts will be made to offer periodically all courses listed in the catalog." Also, Section 3.2.8 states, "The student has the right to expect substantive presentations or other means of instruction appropriate to the course. Repeated lack of preparation and/or unprofessional behavior which result in incompetent performance by the faculty member are legitimate grounds for student complaint."</p>

  <p>Students were deceived into enrolling into this class by the catalog course description mirrored in the syllabus. The professor and the university reaped student tuition while engaging in fraud. Had I known prior to enrolling that this class was actually about applying CRT to technology, I never would have enrolled. I enrolled in this class to learn other software programs as part of the technical writing program. Consequently, I did not assimilate CRT into my responses. I rebutted CRT in my responses because there are other ways to view technology. However, failure to adhere the professor's expectations meant that he would deduct points (usually 50 percent of total points) because students were not allowed to submit opposing viewpoints or point out the hypocrisy, racism, and sexism inherent in the CRT readings that target white men specifically (contrary to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Civil Rights Act). Ironic since the professor is a white man and I am not.</p> 

<p>Further, while this is not an employer/employee situation, the tactics the professor used to coerce students into expressing one narrow viewpoint were equal to constructive discharge tactics. (Constructive discharge occurs when an employer causes the employee’s working conditions to be so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee’s position would feel compelled to quit, but in this case, withdraw from class.) In a constructive discharge case, the employee must show that the employer knew or had reason to know about these conditions yet failed to correct them within a reasonable time period. That is exactly what I did when I submitted a complaint to the head of the department. The dean and head of the department cannot use ignorance as a defense. (See "Complaint" page.)

  <p>The professor really imposed CRT after the drop deadline had passed. The drop deadline was September 20, 2021. Students could not access modules ahead of time to view content for future weeks. The modules were locked until specific dates. (See Syllabus for release dates.) Module 4 did not open until after the drop deadline had passed. After the drop deadline, students would have to withdraw from the class and lose 100 percent of their tuition. In my opinion, these people are running a racket.</p>

  <p>I submitted a complaint to the head of the department on October 25, 2021. (See "Complaint" page.) I submitted a formal grievance to the University's Red Flag Reporting website in January 2022, after the fall semester (2021) ended to ensure that someone outside the English Department and the College of Arts and Humanities was made aware of what was going on inside the English Department. (The grievance is 142 pages long and not uploaded here because it will likely slow the load time for this page.)</p>

  <p>After submitting the original complaint, three things happened with no acknowledgement from the head of the department or the dean of the issues outlined in my original complaint or admission of wrongdoing on the professor's part: (1) The catalog course description for the class disappeared completely from the university website; (2) the content of the readings suddenly changed for Module 5 when the semester was almost over; (3) and hyperlinks to LinkedIn Learning for Adobe InDesign tutorials suddenly materialized for the final exam at the end of the semester. I interpreted this to mean that instead of protecting students from the fraud being perpetrated by the professor, the head of the department and the dean used my complaint to cover up the fraud and protect themselves instead. They did all that silently behind the scenes without a hearing, but the dean wanted to have a hearing to prevent the professor from lowering my grades for subsequent assignments in real time as it was happening when all she had to do was view the quality of my work versus my posted grades in Canvas. (I'm an honors student by the way, which is easily verifiable with my transcripts.)</p>

<p>That is why I am reporting this incident of fraud to the Utah Attorney General's office. I believe there should be outside oversight of academic institutions (not the Utah Board of Education) because these people protect corruption at student expense. University professors and administrators are exploiting students financially and psychologically while circumventing the law at student and taxpayer expense. Students have no recourse within the academic institution. No one is protecting students.</p>
