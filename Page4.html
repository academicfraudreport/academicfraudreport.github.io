 <h2>Complaint</h2>
  <p>Following is the text of the original complaint sent to the head of the department on October 25, 2021. I have printed the entire exchange to PDF. It is 14 pages long. This site contains the first three pages of the exchange. I have deleted the email addresses and names for publication on this site.</p>

  <p>Subject: English [xxxx]</p>
  <p>On Mon, Oct 25, 2021 at 12:16 PM [Student Name] <studentemail.edu> wrote:</p>

  <p>This message is being sent to report problems in Prof. [Name]'s class, English [xxxx]. I prefer
that this go to the English or Student Dean, but I don't have his/her email and the channels for
this type of complaint are not clearly outlined anywhere.</p>

  <p>The course description for English 3130 is as follows:</p>

<ul class="blockquote">
 <li>ENGL [xxxx] - Digital Writing Technologies</li><br>
 <li>Credits: (3)</li><br>
 <li>Typically Taught Fall Semester: Full Sem</li><br>
 <li>Typically Taught Spring Semester: Full Sem</li><br>
 <li>Course Fee: $20.00</li>
</ul>
<br>

  <p class="blockquote">This course will introduce students to the tools/software that technical writers and other
professionals use in the workplace. Topics include, but are not limited to, Advanced
Features in MS Word (styles, macros), the Adobe Suite, Advanced Features of online
collaborative tools (the Google Suite among others), the suite of Apple products. This
instruction prepares students, not just English majors, for the necessary skills to enter into
the workforce prepared to succeed.</p>

  <p>However, students are not learning software in this class. Students were deceived into enrolling
into this class by the catalog description for English [xxxx] so that Prof. [Name] or [University Name] could
reap student tuition. Had I known that this class is actually about applying critical race theory to
technology, I never would have enrolled. I enrolled to learn other software programs as part of
the technical writing program. Students are being assigned reading that expresses the tenets of
critical race theory without ever explicitly stating "critical race theory" anywhere. The readings
are extremely biased and offensive. My goal is to point out the hypocrisy and fraud of critical
race theory in the Reading Responses and Discussions. I'm not going to assimilate critical race
theory into my responses because there are other ways to view technology, but Prof. [Name] is
subtracting 50 percent of the total points for my Reading Response submissions under other
pretexts. His comments and grading are coercive and create a hostile environment. I think Prof.
[Name] is trying to scare or provoke me into withdrawing, but I refuse. I'm not giving him free
money. By the way, I have 158 credits with a 3.5 GPA. I know how to write.</p>

  <p>I'm attaching a PDF with my detailed grades and comments along with some assignments in the
same doc. Notice that the grade and comments for the assignment entitled, "Convert MS Word to
Adobe InDesign" is the exact same template as the assignment entitled, "Create an External
CSS," yet the grades and comments are very different when the latter is much more
comprehensive. Subtracting 50 percent of total grades for assignments is meant to undermine
because I'm the most vocal everywhere about critical race theory's hypocrisy and fraud. This
needs to stop. I'm not going to espouse this professor's ideology. I loathe it and I'm not paying
tuition to take on other peoples' belief systems. I'm in the class to learn software and technology
and nothing else. Don't hijack my funds like this. It's fraud.</p>
